title: Mirroring of historical Subversion repositories on GitHub, possible move of current Mercurial repositories to GitHub
---

We plan to mirror parts of our historical Subversion repository on GitHub. In order to do a proper conversion from Subversion to Git, Subversion author names must be mapped to name-email pairs. An initial set of mappings is available at the bottom of the [Source Control](/SourceControl) page. If you notice errors or omissions, feel free to send us changes or pull requests for the [website sources](https://github.com/JikesRVM/jikesrvm.github.io).

Additionally, we're considering a move of our main repositories to GitHub. This is being discussed on the core [mailing list](/MailingLists).
