title: Migration of source code repositories to GitHub
---

We moved the main source code repository to [GitHub](https://github.com/JikesRVM/JikesRVM). You can clone from [https://github.com/JikesRVM/JikesRVM.git](https://github.com/JikesRVM/JikesRVM.git).

We won't use the GitHub issue tracking; please continue to use [JIRA](https://xtenlang.atlassian.net/browse/RVM) or the [mailing lists](/MailingLists/) to report issues.

The previous workflow for code contributions remains unchanged. In addition to this, we will accept pull requests on GitHub for now. However, we reserve the right to change our minds if we don't like the pull request workflow.
