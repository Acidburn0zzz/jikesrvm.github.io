% TODO When done with everything, make another pass to make sure everything looks ok in HTML and PDF

% TODO turn "published papers" into link (old one was http://docs.codehaus.org/display/RVM/Publications )
The User Guide provides Jikes\textsuperscript{TM} RVM information that is not typically covered in published papers. For high-level overviews, algorithms, and structures, you will find the published papers to be the best starting place. The User Guide supplements these Jikes RVM papers, focusing on implementation details of how to build, run, and add functionality to the system.

You may find sections of the User Guide missing, incomplete or otherwise confusing. We intend this document to live as a continual work-in-progress, hopefully growing and maturing as community members edit and add to the guide. Please accept this invitation to contribute.

% TODO update for github, link mailing lists
Please send feedback, bug fixes, and text contributions to the mailing list. Constructive criticism will be cheerfully accepted.

% TODO: add links
\begin{itemize}
  \item Care and Feeding: The guide to practical aspects of building, testing, debugging and evaluating Jikes RVM.
  \item Architecture: The guide to the major architectural decisions of Jikes RVM.
  \item MMTk Tutorial: A simple tutorial to building a collector with MMTk.

\chapter{Architecture}

This section describes the architecture of Jikes RVM. The RVM can be divided into the following components:

% TODO links
\begin{itemize}
  \item Core Runtime Services: (thread scheduler, class loader, library support, verifier, etc.) This element is responsible for managing all the underlying data structures required to execute applications and interfacing with libraries.
  \item Magic: The mechanisms used by Jikes RVM to support low-level systems programming in Java.
  \item Compilers: (baseline, optimizing, JNI) This component is responsible for generating executable code from bytecodes.
  \item Memory managers: This component is responsible for the allocation and collection of objects during the execution of an application.
  \item Adaptive Optimization System: This component is responsible for profiling an executing application and judiciously using the optimizing compiler to improve its performance.

\chapter{MMTk Tutorial}

% TODO formatting

This tutorial will build up a sophisticated garbage collector from scratch, starting with the empty shell that is the NoGC "collector" in MMTk (collector is a misnomer in this case since NoGC does not collect), and gradually adding functionality.

This tutorial will tell you the mechanics of building a collector in MMTk. It will tell you how but it does not tell you anything about why. The tutorial thus serves two purposes: 1) to give you some insight into the mechanics of MMTk (but not the underlying reasons or design rationale), and 2) show you that the mechanics of building a non-trivial GC in MMTk is not hard, hopefully giving you confidence to start exploring MMTk more deeply.

% TODO use head
The current version of the tutorial was written with respect to the Jikes RVM just prior to 3.0.2. So please use either the head or 3.0.2 (if it is available).
