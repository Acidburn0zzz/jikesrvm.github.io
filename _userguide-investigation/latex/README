LaTeX sources are written using normal LaTeX. The previous LaTeX version of the user guide used Hyperlatex but the project seems to be inactive these days.

The PDF can be build using normal LaTeX tools.

TODO
* port the rest of the asciidoc files so that the coverage of important elements is higher
* customization of the HTML (e.g. CSS) wasn't tested for any of the options yet

Outstanding issues:
* How to convert to HTML? How to get chunked HTML?
* Which tools to try? tex4ht? LaTeXML? Pandoc? hevea? Note: LaTeX2HTML has been discontinued for a while.
* LaTeX -> HTML, LaTeX -> DocBook -> HTML / Chunked HTML or something else?

tex4ht
* htlatex userguide-includes.tex seems to mostly work, including cross references
* Problem: the \bigstar for Magic is much too small.
* chunked HTML can be produced by using
  htlatex userguide-includes.html "html,2"
* TODO According to the manual, configuration of the output ought to be possible via .cfg files

Pandoc
* TODO

LaTexML - http://dlmf.nist.gov/LaTeXML/
* Problems: hyperref cross links do not seem to work and isodate isn't supported
* Chunked HTML is probably doable, but we'd have to read the manual

Hevea - http://hevea.inria.fr/
* can be customized using commands in the LaTeX source
* for Chunked HTML see http://hevea.inria.fr/doc/cutname.html
