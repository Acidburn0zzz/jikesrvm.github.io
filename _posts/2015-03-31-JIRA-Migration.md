title: Migration of Jikes RVM JIRA
---

Due to the approaching shutdown of Codehaus.org at the end of April,
we have migrated the JIRA used for Jikes RVM project issue tracking to
a new location: [https://xtenlang.atlassian.net/projects/RVM](https://xtenlang.atlassian.net/projects/RVM).

The new JIRA is now fully operational and should be used for all Jikes
RVM issues.

Userids were migrated from the old JIRA at Codehaus to the new one,
but for security reasons passwords were not migrated. If you had a
userid in the old JIRA, please use the password reset mechanism to set
a password in the new Jikes RVM JIRA instance. If that doesn't work,
please contact David Grove (groved@us.ibm.com) to make sure your
userid in the new JIRA is associated with the correct email account to
enable the password reset to work.  The [research archive](/Resources/ResearchArchive/)
was always hosted at sourceforge (not codehaus) and has therefore not
been migrated.
