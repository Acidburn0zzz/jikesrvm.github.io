                    <p>To apply to be a Google summer of code organization we need to choose a single administrator to submit an application via the <a href="http://code.google.com/soc/org_signup.html" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">GSoC web app</a> between March 5-12, 2007. Our application needs to cover the following:</p>

<h2 id="OrganizationApplication-Describeyourorganization">Describe your organization</h2>

<p>Jikes RVM (Research Virtual Machine) provides a flexible open testbed to prototype virtual machine technologies and experiment with a large variety of design alternatives. It differs from other JVM projects in that it is written in Java whilst having a full adaptive optimization framework. It is a vehicle for testing a wide range of ideas including compiler research, memory management research, Java operating systems, computer architecture, and aspect oriented programming to name a few. Over 150 research papers have been published which use Jikes RVM.</p>

<h2 id="OrganizationApplication-WhyisyourorganizationapplyingtoparticipateinGSoC2007?Whatdoyouhopetogainbyparticipating?">Why is your organization applying to participate in GSoC 2007? What do you hope to gain by participating?</h2>

<p>We hope to participate in the GSoC so that we can attract new contributors, familiar with the system. We are offering a wide range of projects, some involve very novel ideas, others involve interesting engineering, while others require more straightforward coding.  We hope that fixes and improvements can occur in some of the neglected parts of the source code.</p>

<p>We didn't participate in GSoC 2005 or 2006.</p>

<p>More mentors please volunteer! <strong>TODO: get more mentors</strong></p>

<h2 id="OrganizationApplication-Whatcriteriadidyouusetoselecttheseindividualsasmentors?Pleasebeasspecificaspossible">What criteria did you use to select these individuals as mentors? Please be as specific as possible</h2>

<p>Mentors are members of the Jikes RVM core development team. This means they have made significant contributions to Jikes RVM and are experts.  Most or all of the mentors have demonstrated expertise in their relevant academic research domains through publications.</p>

<h2 id="OrganizationApplication-Whatisyourplanfordealingwithdisappearingstudents?">What is your plan for dealing with disappearing students?</h2>

<p>Students will not have inter-dependent projects, so the impact of a student leaving is limited to the missing student and the project they were engaged in.</p>

<p>Moreover, we hope students won't disappear. We hope to achieve this by friendly and timely mentoring, in particular at the start of the student's project when possibly they will have a steep learning curve to climb to understand the system. If a student appears to be fading then we hope to engage them in conversation about what the problems are that they are facing and explain to them the importance of their work to the project as a whole.</p>

<h2 id="OrganizationApplication-Whatisyourplanfordealingwithdisappearingmentors?">What is your plan for dealing with disappearing mentors?</h2>

<p>The Jikes RVM core team (from which the mentors are drawn) is very well established and stable. As established members of the Jikes RVM community, we expect mentors will be fully available to aid students during the GSoC.  Each of the mentors has overlapping skill sets.  So in the unlikely event that a mentor is unable to help a student then we will shift responsibility for that student on to another mentor with similar skills to the mentor who has become unavailable.</p>

<h2 id="OrganizationApplication-Whatstepswillyoutaketoencouragestudentstointeractwithyourproject&#39;scommunitybefore,duringandaftertheprogram?">What steps will you take to encourage students to interact with your project's community before, during and after the program?</h2>

<p>As the primary means of communication for the project are e-mail and IRC we will give all students a warm welcome on these forums. As a student working on the project they will rapidly get the skills where they can be full members of the development community. Mentors will be encouraged to let students report on their work and engage the community as a whole. If appropriate different forms of communication can be used such as telephone. We hope students will be proud of their work and supportive of the project. The skills they learn can be stepping stones to their future career. The more they can understand about the system the more people they can interact with and the better they can improve their own skills.</p>

<h2 id="OrganizationApplication-WhatwillyoudotoensurethatyouracceptedstudentsstickwiththeprojectafterGSoCconcludes?">What will you do to ensure that your accepted students stick with the project after GSoC concludes?</h2>

<p>We hope to continue to engage the students with the many bugs and improvement requests the project gets. We hope the students will have the confidence to look at our trackers and contribute as they feel best. As a development community we will continue to be supportive of their contributions.</p>
