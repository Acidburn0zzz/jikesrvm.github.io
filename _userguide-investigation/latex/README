LaTeX sources are written using normal LaTeX. The previous LaTeX version of the user guide used Hyperlatex but the project seems to be inactive these days.

The PDF can be build using normal LaTeX tools.

TODO
* customization of the HTML (e.g. CSS) wasn't tested for most of the options yet

Outstanding issues:
* How to convert to HTML? How to get chunked HTML?
* Which tools to try? tex4ht? LaTeXML? Pandoc? hevea? Note: LaTeX2HTML has been discontinued for a while.
* LaTeX -> HTML, LaTeX -> DocBook -> HTML / Chunked HTML or something else?

tex4ht
* htlatex userguide-includes.tex seems to mostly work, including cross references
* minor problem: the \bigstar on the Magic page is much too small
* chunked HTML can be produced by using
  htlatex userguide-includes.tex "html,2"
* to produce chunked HTML using htlatex and a configuration with our CSS, use
  htlatex userguide-inclues.text "html-website.cfg,html,2"
* TODO Do we need the user guide HTML version to conform to the website layout? If so, we need to research how this can be accomplished without duplicating the HTML code in LaTeX.

Pandoc
* TODO

LaTexML - http://dlmf.nist.gov/LaTeXML/
* Problems: hyperref cross links do not seem to work and isodate isn't supported
* Chunked HTML is probably doable, but we'd have to read the manual

Hevea - http://hevea.inria.fr/
* can be customized using commands in the LaTeX source
* for Chunked HTML see http://hevea.inria.fr/doc/cutname.html
