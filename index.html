<p>Jikes RVM (Research Virtual Machine) provides a flexible open
testbed to prototype virtual machine technologies and experiment with
a large variety of design alternatives. The system is licensed under
an OSI approved <a href="License.html">license</a>. Jikes RVM
runs on <a href="Supported-Platforms.html">many platforms</a>
and advances the state-of-the-art of virtual machine technologies for
dynamic compilation, adaptive optimization, garbage collection, thread
scheduling, and synchronization. A distinguishing characteristic of
Jikes RVM is that it is implemented in the Javaâ„¢ programming language
and is self-hosted i.e., its Java code runs on itself without
requiring a second virtual machine. Most other virtual machines for
the Java platform are written in native code (typically, C or C++). A
Java implementation provides ease of portability, and a seamless
integration of virtual machine and application resources such as
objects, threads, and operating-system interfaces.</p>

<p>Many <a href="http://docs.codehaus.org/display/RVM/Current+Users">researchers</a>
have found that Jikes RVM provides a useful vehicle
for <a href="http://docs.codehaus.org/display/RVM/Resources#Resources-research">research</a>
on the frontiers of virtual machine technologies (over
188 <a href="http://docs.codehaus.org/display/RVM/Publications">publications</a>
and
36 <a href="http://docs.codehaus.org/display/RVM/Dissertations">dissertations</a>),
as well
