                    <p>The garbage collectors for Jikes RVM are provided by MMTk. The <a href="http://cs.anu.edu.au/~Robin.Garner/mmtk-guide.pdf" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">MMTk: The Memory Manager Toolkit</a> describes MMTk and gives a tutorial on how to use and edit it and is the best place to start.  An updated version of the tutorial is <a href="MMTk-Tutorial_114788062.html">here</a>. A detailed description of the call chain from the compilers through to MMTk <a href="Memory-Allocation-in-JikesRVM_196640936.html">here</a> is another good place to start understanding how MMTk integrates with JikesRVM.  <a href="Anatomy-of-a-Garbage-Collector_230400224.html">Anatomy of a Garbage Collector</a> describes the major building blocks of an MMTk collector and <a href="Scanning-Objects-in-JikesRVM_196640942.html">Scanning Objects in JikesRVM</a> describes how objects are scanned for their pointer fields during GC.  MMTk also has a pure Java <a href="The-MMTk-Test-Harness_91750431.html">test harness</a> that allows development of garbage collectors in an IDE like eclipse.</p><p>The RVM can be configured to employ various different allocation managers taken from the <a href="MMTk_73767.html">MMTk</a> memory management toolkit. Managers divide the available space up as they see fit. However, they normally subdivide the available address range to provide:</p><ul><li>a metadata area which enables the manager to track the status of allocated and unallocated storage in the rest of the heap.</li><li>an immortal data area used to service allocations of objects which are expected to persist across the whole lifetime of the RVM runtime.</li><li>a large object space used to service allocations of objects which are larger than some specified size (e.g. a virtual memory page) - the large object space may employ a different allocation and reclamation strategy to that used for other objects.</li><li>a small object allocation area which may be divided into e.g.two semi spaces, a nursery space and a mature space, a set of generations, a non-relocatable buddy hierarchy etc depending upon the allocation and reclamation strategy employed by the memory manager.</li></ul><p>Virtual memory pages are lazily mapped into the RVM's memory image as they are needed.</p><p>The main class which is used to interface to the memory manager is called <code>Plan</code>. Each flavor of the manager is implemented by substituting a different implementation of this class. Most plans inherit from class <code>StopTheWorldGC</code> which ensures that all active mutator threads (i.e. ones which do not perform the job of reclaiming storage) are suspended before reclamation is commenced. The argument passed to <code>-X:processors</code> determines the number of parallel collector threads that will be used for collection.</p><p>Generational collectors employ a plan which inherits from class <code>Generational</code> Inter alia, this class ensures that a write barrier is employed so that updates from old to new spaces are detected.</p><p><span style="font-size: 10.0pt;line-height: 13.0pt;">Jikes RVM may also use the </span><a href="Using-GCSpy_73247.html">GCSpy</a><span style="font-size: 10.0pt;line-height: 13.0pt;"> visualization framework. GCSpy allows developers to observe the behavior of the heap and related data structures.</span></p>
