title: Migration of Jikes RVM User Guide
---

The user guide, which was previously exported from Confluence, has been rewritten in LaTeX. It is now exported to HTML with [tex4ht](https://www.tug.org/tex4ht/) and available at the normal [user guide link](http://www.jikesrvm.org/UserGuide). As a result of this change, the organisation of the user guide pages and the links have changed. Please update your boomarks.

If you notice problems in the new user guide, please open an [issue](/IssueTrackers/) or contact us on the [mailing lists](/MailingLists/). If you want to make changes to the website yourself, take a look at [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/JikesRVM/jikesrvm.github.io). To get your changes applied, send us patches or open a pull request at GitHub.

If you need access to the old user guide as exported from Confluence, see [here](https://github.com/JikesRVM/jikesrvm.github.io/tree/master/_archive/ConfluenceUserGuide).
