Jikes RVM (Research Virtual Machine) provides a flexible open testbed
to prototype virtual machine technologies and experiment with a large
variety of design alternatives. The system is licensed under an OSI
approved [license](License.html). Jikes RVM runs on [many
platforms](Supported-Platforms.html)and advances the state-of-the-art
of virtual machine technologies for dynamic compilation, adaptive
optimization, garbage collection, thread scheduling, and
synchronization. A distinguishing characteristic of Jikes RVM is that
it is implemented in the Javaâ„¢ programming language and is self-hosted
i.e., its Java code runs on itself without requiring a second virtual
machine. Most other virtual machines for the Java platform are written
in native code (typically, C or C++). A Java implementation provides
ease of portability, and a seamless integration of virtual machine and
application resources such as objects, threads, and operating-system
interfaces.

Many
[researchers](http://docs.codehaus.org/display/RVM/Current+Users)have
found that Jikes RVM provides a useful vehicle for
[research](http://docs.codehaus.org/display/RVM/Resources#Resources-research)on
the frontiers of virtual machine technologies (over 188
[publications](http://docs.codehaus.org/display/RVM/Publications)and
36
[dissertations](http://docs.codehaus.org/display/RVM/Dissertations)),
as well as [teaching
courses](http://docs.codehaus.org/display/RVM/Resources#Resources-teaching). If
you are looking for where to start reading about the Jikes RVM we have
a [recommended reading](Recommended-Reading.html)page.
