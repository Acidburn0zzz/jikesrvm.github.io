title: Google Summer Of Code 2012
--- 

We have been accepted in&nbsp; [Google Summer of Code 2012](http://code.google.com/soc) as a mentoring organization. See [here](http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/org/google/gsoc2012/jikesrvm) for details. To that end, we are looking for project applications - see our [ideas page](/display/RVM/Google+Summer+of+Code+2012). We have suggested both new and&nbsp;repeat proposals. It is part of the student's responsibilities to flesh out their own proposals, so don't hesitate to suggest crazy and/or sketchy ideas on the researchers [mailing list](/MailingLists/).

The deadline for student applications at [google-melange.com](/pages/createpage.action?spaceKey=RVM&title=google-melange.com) is _ **Friday 6 April** _.
