% Note: Front Matter is NOT inserted via this template. As of June 2015 (on Ubuntu 15.04), each line that's produced via \HCode has a space at the end. This leads to "---" as being emitted as "--- " which won't be recognized b Jekyll. If that were fixed, front matter could be generated for the HTML files with the following lines.
% \Configure{DOCTYPE}{\HCode{---\Hnewline layout: default\Hnewline---\Hnewline\Hnewline} % Jekyll frontmatter
% The default DOCTYPE that htlatex uses right now
% \HCode{<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/loose.dtd">\Hnewline}}
