#### Guidelines

If you are not sure which mailing list is the right one, use jikesrvm-researchers. Do not post the same message to multiple mailing lists.

Please introduce yourself when posting for the first time. You should also state your affiliation (e.g. your university) if it's not obvious from your email address.

Please read [How To Ask Questions The Smart Way](http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html) if you are unfamiliar with interactions in open source projects.
