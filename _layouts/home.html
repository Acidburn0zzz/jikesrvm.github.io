  <p>Jikes RVM (Research Virtual Machine) provides a flexible open testbed to prototype virtual machine technologies and experiment with a large variety of design alternatives. The system is licensed under an OSI approved <a href="License_74077.html">license</a>. Jikes RVM runs on <a href="Supported-Platforms_74735.html">many platforms</a> and advances the state-of-the-art of virtual machine technologies for dynamic compilation, adaptive optimization, garbage collection, thread scheduling, and synchronization. A distinguishing characteristic of Jikes RVM is that it is implemented in the Javaâ„¢ programming language and is self-hosted i.e., its Java code runs on itself without requiring a second virtual machine. Most other virtual machines for the Java platform are written in native code (typically, C or C++). A Java implementation provides ease of portability, and a seamless integration of virtual machine and application resources such as objects, threads, and operating-system interfaces.</p>

 <p>Many <a href="http://docs.codehaus.org/display/RVM/Current+Users">researchers</a> have found that Jikes RVM provides a useful vehicle for <a href="http://docs.codehaus.org/display/RVM/Resources#Resources-research">research</a> on the frontiers of virtual machine technologies (over 188 <a href="http://docs.codehaus.org/display/RVM/Publications">publications</a> and 36 <a href="http://docs.codehaus.org/display/RVM/Dissertations">dissertations</a>), as well as <a href="http://docs.codehaus.org/display/RVM/Resources#Resources-teaching">teaching courses</a>. If you are looking for where to start reading about the Jikes RVM we have a <a href="Recommended-Reading_74737.html">recommended reading</a> page.</p>
