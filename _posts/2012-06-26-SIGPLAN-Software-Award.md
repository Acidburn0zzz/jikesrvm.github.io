title: Jikes RVM wins 2012 SIGPLAN Software Award
--- 

The significant impact of the Jikes RVM research community was recently recognized by ACM's Special Interest Group on Programming Languages (SIGPLAN) who awarded the 2012 SIGPLAN Software Award to Jikes RVM. Quoting from [the award citation](http://www.sigplan.org/Awards/Software/2012).

_Jikes RVM was the first Java-in-Java virtual machine and contains many innovations, especially on adaptive optimization and memory management._

_The high quality and modular design of Jikes has made it easy for researchers to develop, share, and compare advances in programming language implementation. The Jikes RVM core team has nurtured and supported a large community of researchers; this is witnessed by more than 200 papers, at least 40 dissertations, close to 25 courses, and research at almost 100 universities, that are based on the Jikes RVM._

The award names thirty two individuals who have made significant contributions to the project since it began in 1997. It also calls out the much larger set of code contributors and researchers who have made the Jikes RVM community possible with their energy and involvement. Congratulations and thank you to everyone who has been part of the Jikes RVM research community over the years!
