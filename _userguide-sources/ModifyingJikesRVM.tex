The sections \hyperref[sec:codingstyle]{Coding Style} and \hyperref[sec:codingconventions]{Coding Conventions} give a rough overview on existing coding conventions.

Don't hesitate to \href{http://www.jikesrvm.org/HowToHelp/}{help rectify this} by contributing clean-ups, refactorings, bug fixes, tests and missing documentation to the project.
