Use asciidoc IncludeAll.adoc to build the HTML version for everything on one page. Use asciidoc fileName to build a HTML document for a single page.

To build the PDF version using asciidoctor-pdf ( https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-pdf ) :
From the asciidoctor-pdf repository, use 
bundle exec bin/asciidoctor-pdf userguide-investigation/asciidoc/IncludeAll.adoc

If you do not want to use asciidoctor-pdf, use
a2x -f pdf --dblatex-opts "-P latex.output.revhistory=0 -Pdoc.toc.show=0" IncludeAll.adoc

To create chunked HTML for the website, use
a2x -f pdf --dblatex-opts "-P latex.output.revhistory=0 -Pdoc.toc.show=0" IncludeAll.adoc


Outstanding issues:
* I don't know how to avoid making a title page which would be interesting when editing a single .adoc document
* I could only get links to work with asciidoctor cross references (i.e. they don't work with asciidoc or a2x) and even those are not properly converted to PDF (colored text but not clickable which is IMHO worse than just replacing them with uncolored text). Moreover, using cross references prevents us from using a2x because they will cause errors as asciidoc doesn't understand them.
* Can we do chunked HTML using asciidoctor?

Notes:
* the eps on the Cost Benefit Model page isn't properly displayed but this is also the case for the old user guide on the old website, so it's not a regression
